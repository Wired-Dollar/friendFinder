Home.html is taking the place of Index.html and is the main face for the UI, it is the first thing that the user will see. Survey.html is the survey that is displayed to the user after the onClick of "Begin Survey" button. Friends.js tells Express server how to hold our data. apiRoutes.js holds the math and the call keys for Express. htmlRoutes.js determines how each of our pages are connected and the required path they are to take in order to properly dispay the UI and transfer the data. Server.js determines which ports the app is to use. Express servers hold our data and Heroku holds the app to allow for interactive UX for the survey. Total sum amounts are taken to determine a users overall # which is then compared to other users numbers and the number that is closest to current users overall number is determined to be best match and that users pic and profile information is displayed to the user. This is the basic formula for all survey based match sites... usually "dating apps"... although it could be used for other things also... like where to live, vacation, work, eat, etc.
